## Peer Review of Group 3-2

## Introduction and Data

Is the research question and goal of the report clearly stated?

The research question and goal is very clearly stated. However, if possible, I would suggest that either in the introduction or in methodology to have a some text describing you're going to do. For example, "we decided to use linear regression to see if there would be particular factor that is the strongest predictor of morality." 

Does the introduction provide appropriate background context and motivation for a general reader?

Is the source of the data stated with an appropriate citation?

Is it clear when and how the data was collected?

Is data manipulation described clearly (missing data, creation of new variables, etc)?

Are the cases and relevant variables described?

## Methodology

Do the visualizations correspond to the stated research question?

Are visualizations effective and do they follow the visualization principles we have discussed in STA 199 (including elements like titles, labels, appropriate for the type of data, etc)?

Is the choice of statistical method justified?

## Results

Are the chosen techniques for answering the research question appropriate for the research context and type of data?

Is the research question answered effectively?

## Discussion

Is the answer to the research question summarized and supported by statistical arguments?

Are limitations of the analysis clearly outlined?

## General

Is the writing clear (including elements like spelling, grammar, etc)? Are you able to follow what is being done?

Is the coding clear? Are you able to follow precisely what is being done?

Are you able to reproduce all aspects of the report, including output, visualizations, etc? Have the reproducibility principles we have discussed in STA 199 been followed?

Is the report well-formatted and readable (including layout but also only reporting relevant output, with no extraneous code, visuals, etc)?

Have they appropriate outlined the next steps with gaps clearly defined?

Any suggestions for them moving forward?

## Final Considerations

What is one question you have for the group after reading their analysis?

What is one thing the group has done especially well?
